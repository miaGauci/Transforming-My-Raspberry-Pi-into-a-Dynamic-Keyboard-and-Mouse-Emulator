Python Notes and Examples

### Definitions 
- Module; a program that can be imported to other programs, so that the fucntions and operations defined in the module can be reused in another program 

```
#Class 1 
def printsmth():
  print "Hiya:)"
  
#Class2
import myfirstmodule
myfirstmodule.printsmth()

#Output ;
#Hiya:)
```

- __ is used to create a local variable to the class 

Example: __delay; is only local to the class it is initialised if called from another class it is not found 

## if __name__ == "__main__":
- tells the program that the code inside this if statement should only be executed if the program is executed as a standalone program 
- If the class containing this line is called from another program the lines of code under if __name__ == "__main__": will not be executed 
- hence if __name__ == "__main__": is used for testing purposes to make sure that the program works properly 

Difference between == and is operator 
  - The 'is' operator compares the identity of two objects while the == operator compares the values of two objects

Working with JSON 
```
import json 

from typing import Union !! research
```
JSON -> Python 
```
json.loads(x)
```
Python -> JSON
```
json.dumps(x)

file_name = "data1.json"
with open(file_name) as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    
print(data)
```
### Special Variables in Python 

A double underscore variable in Python is usually referred to as a dunder
  - python uses these variables in a 'special way'

The __init__ method for initialization is invoked when an instance of a class is created 

__init__ is a **constructor**

```
#Prints only the memory address of the string object 
# declare our own string class
class String:
      
    # magic method to initiate object
    def __init__(self, string):
        #Self allows access to the attributes and methods of each object in python (like this. in Java )
        self.string = string
          
# Driver Code
if __name__ == '__main__': #important used to check that class is working properly without affecting other classes 
      
    # object creation
    string1 = String('Hello')
  
    # print object location
    print(string1)
    
    #Output
    #<__main__.String object at 0x7fe992215390>
```

Representing our object using __repr__
```
# declare our own string class
class String:
      
    # magic method to initiate object
    #always put self as a parameter 
    #string is the parameter passed to the class
    def __init__(self, string):
        self.string = string
          
    # print our string object
    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Object: {}'.format(self.string)
  
# Driver Code
if __name__ == '__main__':
      
    # object creation
    string1 = String('Hello')
  
    # print object location
    print(string1)
    
    #output
    #Object: Hello
```

__file__ - contains the path to the module that is currently being imported from a different class 
         - this variable is updated using the import system
         
```
#Creating a method called 'hello' in a diff class 
def hello():
  print("this is imported from a different class");
  
#Importing the above and creating a new module 
import HelloWorld

#Calling the method created inside the module 
HelloWorld.hello()

#Printing the path of the HelloWorld file 
print(HelloWorld.__file__)
```
__new__ method
- Creates and returns the instance of a class
- __new__ method is a static method 
- It is required to pass a parameter cls 
- cls represents the class that is needed to be instantiated and the compiler automatically provides this parameter at the time of instantiaiton
- Using the cls keyword, we can only access the members of the class, whereas using the self keyword, we can access both the instance variables and the class attributes.
```
class Students(object):
	def __init__(self, idNo, grade):
		self._idNo = idNo
		self._grade = grade

	def __new__(cls, idNo, grade):
		print("Creating Instance")
		instance = super(Students, cls).__new__(cls)
		if 5 <= grade <= 10:
			return instance
		else:
			return None

	def __str__(self):
		return '{0}({1})'.format(self.__class__.__name__, self.__dict__)


stud1 = Students(1, 7)
print(stud1)

stud2 = Students(2, 12)
print(stud2)

```
### Syntax: super()

Return : Return a proxy object which represents the parentâ€™s class.

#### First let us understand how inheritance in Python works 
Creating a Parent Class 
```
#Creating a Person class with Display methods 

# In Python 3.x "class Person" is
# equivalent to "class Person(object)"
class Person(object):

	#constructor of class 
	def __init__(self, name, id)
		self.name = name 
		self.id = id 
		
	#To check if the person is an employee 
	def Display(self):
		print(self.name, self.id)
		
	#Driver code 
	emp = Person("Mia", 102) #An object of a Person 
	emp.Display()
```
Creating a Child Class

```
class Emp(Person):
	 def Print(self):
	 	print("Emp class called:")
	Emp_details = Emp("Amy", 103)
	
	#calling the parent class function 
	Emp_details.Display()
	
	#calling child class function 
	Emp_details.Print()
```

Now

In an inherited subclass, a parent class can be referred with the used of the **super()** function. The super function returns a temporary object of the superclass that allows access to all of its methods to its child class

advantages; 
- You don't need to specify the parent class name to access its methods - can be used in both single and multiple inheritances 
- Super function is dynamic which continues to prove how Python is a dynamic language

```
#The classes dogs, cats and horses are a subclasses of animal class - single inheritance 
#Super function below
class Animals: 
	#initializing constructor 
	def __init__(self):
		self.legs = 4
		self.domestic = True 
		self.tail = True 
		self.mammals = True 
		
	def isMammal(self):
		if self.mammals:
			print("It is a mammal.")
#Dogs is a subclass of super class Animals 			
class Dogs(Animals)
	def __init__(self):
		super().__init__()
	
	def isMammal(self):
		super().isMammal()

class Horses(Animals):
	def __init__(self):
		super().__init__()
		
	def hasTailandLegs(self):
		if self.tail and self.legs == 4:
			print("Has legs and tail")
			
#Driver code 
Tom = Dogs()
Tom.isMammal()
Bruno = Horses()
Bruno.hasTailandLegs 
```
